- Queue is a linear data structure that follows First-In, First Out (FIFO).

The first item added is the first one to be removed. 

Ex: Line at a ticket counter : យើងឈរទិញសំបុត្រមុនត្រូបានមុនគេ

- Concept Diagram 

(មុខ)​ Front ->[10] [20] [30] <- Rear (ក្រោយ)

enqueue(40) -> 40 will goes at the rear (យើងដាក់ធាតុចូលវានៅទៅក្រោយគេ)
dequeue() -> remove 10 យើងដក់ធាតុចេញវានឹងធ្វើការដក់អានៅមុនគេវិញ

- Common Queue Operation 
+ offer() : add element to the end 
+ pull() : Remove and return front element 
+ peek() : Return the top element without removing it 
+ isEmpty() : check if stack is empty 

* Real-World Use Cased * 

+ Print Queue : document print in the order they were sent
+ Task Scheduling : OS schedules task or threads using queues. 
+ Customer Service system : Calls or chats are served in order. 
+ Streaming Data : Event/message streams (like Kafka) often follow FIFO order.
